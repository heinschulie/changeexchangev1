    Hi! You’ve clicked into the Change Exchange, a resource centre made just for you by <a title="BrightRock" href="http://www.brightrock.co.za/" target="_blank">BrightRock</a>. It’s here to help you deal with life’s big deal changes and how they affect you, your health, your life and your pocket. You can find expert content and guidance, chat to other people going through the same changes as you, ask questions, and attend online events.

    <span style="color: #ff9900; font-size: 18px;"><strong>About the Change Moments you’ll find here</strong></span>

    We’re not talking change as in a new hairstyle or a new tattoo. We’re talking about those moments when CHANGE happens in capital letters; when the course of your life will probably be changed forever, even if it’s just by a couple of degrees. Like <a title="Starting a family" href="http://changeexchange.brightrock.co.za/category/change-moments/starting-a-family/">starting a family</a>, the first of the Change Moments you can explore here. Watch this space – there’s more change to come.

    <span style="color: #ff9900; font-size: 18px;"><strong>Our change-lovin’ approach</strong></span>

    A Change Moment is the instant you say “I do”, hold your new bundle of joy for the first time, or get the keys to your new front door. And with it (besides some BIG emotions), comes a very real impact on how you think about and manage your money for today and for the future.

    That’s exactly what we found when we decided to start <a title="BrightRock" href="http://www.brightrock.co.za/" target="_blank">BrightRock</a> and do our best to change the way the life insurance industry works. (But that’s a story for another page, and you can read it <a href="http://bookshelf.brightrock.co.za/StoryBook/" target="_blank">here</a>.) And it’s why we feel like helping you live and love your way through <i>your</i> life’s biggest Change Moments is just the right thing for us to do.

    <span style="color: #ff9900; font-size: 18px;"><strong>What you can expect from a Change Exchange experience</strong></span>

    [one_half padding="10px 0px 10px 20px"]

    <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Credible, independent voices: </strong></span>
    The Change Agents who contribute their knowledge, advice and experiences to this website are either experts in their field, or people who’ve lived through the Change Moments themselves – in most cases, they’re both.
    <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Different views and voices: </strong></span>
    Loving change is also about loving difference and diversity, and respecting individuality. You’ll find that reflected in the people we’ve chosen to contribute to the Change Exchange and in the various topics we discuss. Their opinions are their own and don’t necessarily represent BrightRock’s views.
    <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>No hard-sell tactics: </strong></span>
    We’ll be completely upfront about it when we’re telling you about BrightRock’s products, or where someone we’re quoting is from BrightRock. But the Change Exchange is about much more than life insurance. It’s about life.

    <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>Respect and privacy: </strong></span>
    We’ll treat you with respect and keep your data private. We won’t access any of your social media data when you log into Facebook, Twitter or other social networks while using the Change Exchange. We won’t use your social graph for our marketing purposes. And we’ll never send you information that you haven’t asked for.
    <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>No substitute for professional medical or financial advice:</strong></span>
    We’ve sourced the articles and content you find on the Change Exchange for your education and entertainment. And while our experts may touch on health or financial matters, this is not intended to replace professional medical or financial advice. When it comes to making the right decisions for your specific circumstances, it’s important that you always seek independent, professional advice from a qualified healthcare practitioner or financial adviser.
